These debates have emerged as a response to failures of the welfare state on the one hand, and the threat to employment posed by increasing automation on the other. While issues surrounding introduction and maintenance of the UBI have been explored at some length in sociological and political science literature, economics as a discipline has been slow to enter this discussion. This paper applies a new institutional economic framework to explore the effects of UBI on the economy as well as broader social effects. It shows that while the costs of implementation and the threat of work disincentives are greater than has previously been indicated, the benefits of introducing a UBI far outweigh the drawbacks, particularly when an ongoing decrease in manual and middle class jobs due to automation is assumed.

Did colonialism play a part in leading to the conflict?\" Here is a student's essay introduction and conclusion in response to this question. \"The First World War was one of the largest conflicts of the 20th century, leading to millions of deaths both in Europe and around the world. Unlike other conflicts in the 20th century, the causes of the conflict were many and various, and historians have had a difficult time deciding what the primary causes were. The system of alliances, rising militarism amongst the Great Powers, the politics surrounding a united Germany, and even the Industrial Revolution have been posited as short and long term causes of the war. However, it is two of these in particular - the system of alliances in Europe, and a military arms race in Europe - that were particularly prominent causes of the conflict. To sum up, the combination of the system of alliances and rising militarism amongst European countries - leading to an arms race amongst the countries - were the two main causes of the First World War. The system of alliances lead to an \"excessively rigid framework\" (Taylor, 1969), which was unable to deal with diplomatic events such as the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Coupled with this was the immense military buildup and planning amongst the Great Powers, which created a great impetus for war. It is these two issues, in excess of others, that led to the bloodshed of the First World War.\" The student has unfortunately failed to address one part of the question. Which part of the question has the student failed to answer? a. The system of alliances amongst the Great Powers. b. The role of colonialism in causing the First World War. c. The military arms race as a cause of the First World War. d. Domestic issues for the European Great Powers.",
